    "\n",
    "The `calculate_ndcg` function computes the Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain (NDCG), a common metric in recommendation systems for evaluating the quality of ranked recommendations. NDCG assesses how well the order of recommended items aligns with their relevance scores, which is especially useful when prioritizing highly relevant items at the top of a recommendation list.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function takes a list of relevance scores and an optional parameter `k`, which limits the calculation to the top `k` items. If `k` is not specified, it considers all items in the relevance list. It first calculates the DCG (Discounted Cumulative Gain) by summing the relevance scores, each divided by a logarithmic discount based on its position. This gives more weight to items at the top of the ranking. The function then calculates the IDCG (Ideal DCG) by sorting the relevance scores in descending order, simulating a perfect ranking, and applying the same discounting process. Finally, NDCG is obtained by dividing DCG by IDCG, normalizing the score between 0 and 1, where 1 indicates a perfectly ordered list. This metric provides a clear measure of how well a recommendation system ranks relevant items."

    "The `load_and_preprocess_data` function loads and preprocesses the TMDB movie dataset by merging two CSV files: one containing credits and another containing movie details. It renames and aligns columns for merging, then combines both datasets on the `id` column. After merging, the function creates a `combined_features` column by concatenating the movie’s `overview`, `keywords` (given double weight), and `genres` (given triple weight) for enriched content-based filtering. For improved rating representation, a Bayesian average is applied to normalize ratings, considering the dataset's mean rating (`C`) and a threshold (`m`) set at the 90th percentile of vote counts. The function then creates an index for each movie and returns both the modified DataFrame and a dictionary mapping each movie's `id` to its index."

The `fit` method trains the model on a dataset by transforming the `combined_features` of each movie into a TF-IDF matrix, which it then uses to compute cosine similarities between movies. It also calculates and stores the importance of each feature by aggregating TF-IDF scores. The `recommend` method retrieves the top `n` similar movies based on cosine similarity scores for a specified movie index, while the `get_genre_diversity` method calculates genre diversity across a set of recommended movies by identifying unique genres within their descriptions. This class enables content-based recommendations with a focus on feature relevance and genre diversity."

This matrix is then normalized to standardize the range of values, followed by computing cosine similarity scores between movies to create the similarity matrix. Using the `recommend` method, the system suggests the top `n` similar movies for a given movie index, excluding the movie itself from the list. If the model has not been fitted, it raises an error. This class provides collaborative recommendations by analyzing similarities within a multi-feature rating space."

    "   - Initializes separate recommender systems: content-based (`EnhancedContentBasedRecommender`), collaborative (`EnhancedCollaborativeRecommender`), and hybrid (`EnhancedHybridRecommender`).\n",
    "   - Includes a `verbose` option for detailed logging and an empty dictionary for evaluation metrics.\n",
    "\n",

    "   - Loads and preprocesses movie and credits data from specified paths.\n",
    "   - Trains the individual recommenders with the processed DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Movie Recommendations (`get_recommendations` method)**:\n",
    "   - Looks up a movie by its title to find its index in the dataset.\n",
    "   - Generates content-based, collaborative, and hybrid recommendations for the selected movie.\n",
    "   - Returns each method's results as lists of (title, score) pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Evaluation (`evaluate_recommendations` method)**:\n",
    "   - Evaluates recommendations across a random subset of movies (default 100) using metrics such as similarity, diversity, novelty, and nDCG (Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain).\n",

    "4. **Generate Recommendations**:\n",
    "   - Takes a sample movie title, `\"The Dark Knight\"`, and requests recommendations from each method.\n",
    "   - Displays recommendations for each method, formatted with movie titles and similarity scores.\n",

    "5. **Evaluation and Visualization**:\n",
    "   - Runs the `evaluate_recommendations` method to assess recommendation quality based on similarity, diversity, novelty, and nDCG.\n",

    "## Recommendations Breakdown\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Content-based Recommendations**:\n",
    "   - The recommendations closely match \"The Dark Knight\" based on content attributes like genre, keywords, or actors.\n",
    "   - Movies like *The Dark Knight Rises* and *Batman Begins* appear at the top, which aligns well since they share similar content features (same franchise, characters, or themes).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Collaborative Recommendations**:\n",
    "   - This method suggests highly popular movies across genres, indicating it captures user ratings and popularity patterns.\n",
    "   - Movies like *Inception*, *The Lord of the Rings*, and *Forrest Gump* appear due to their high overall ratings and appeal, showing strong similarity in rating patterns rather than content.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Hybrid Recommendations**:\n",
    "   - This method combines content-based and collaborative results, providing a balance. Top movies are *The Dark Knight Rises* and *Batman Begins*, while other popular titles like *Inception* are also recommended, reflecting the influence of both collaborative filtering and content similarities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### System Evaluation\n",
    "After generating recommendations, the system runs a comprehensive evaluation. Metrics like similarity, diversity, novelty, and nDCG (normalized discounted cumulative gain) are calculated for each recommendation method:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Similarity** measures how closely the recommended items match the input movie’s attributes.\n",
    "- **Diversity** reflects the range of different genres or themes in the recommendations.\n",
    "- **Novelty** accounts for how unexpected or lesser-known the recommendations are.\n",
    "- **nDCG** assesses ranking quality, giving higher weight to relevant items appearing earlier in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization of Results\n",
    "The final heatmap visualizes these metrics, helping identify strengths and trade-offs across methods. For instance, the hybrid approach might balance similarity with diversity, while the content-based method may excel in delivering high-similarity recommendations."
